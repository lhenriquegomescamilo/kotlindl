/**
 * Pins down which acceleration backends *this module on its own* can reach: none. On the classpath
 * of `:tensorflow` alone, TensorFlow runs on the CPU.
 *
 * Apple Metal is reachable, but only through the optional `:tensorflow-metal` artifact
 * (`kotlin-deeplearning-tensorflow-metal`), which targets JDK 22+ and calls
 * `TF_LoadPluggableDeviceLibrary` via the Foreign Function & Memory API. That module is deliberately
 * *not* a dependency here, which is exactly what these tests assert: nothing registers a device
 * behind a caller's back, and a plain `:tensorflow` user gets unchanged CPU behaviour.
 *
 * Note the distinction these tests draw. TensorFlow Java 1.0.0 exposes no *Java binding* for
 * pluggable devices, but the shipped native does export the symbol -- which is why the optional
 * module can reach it without new native code. A failure here therefore means one of two things:
 * a TensorFlow Java upgrade added the binding (it landed upstream in 1.1.0), or something put the
 * Metal plugin on this module's classpath. Neither is a bug to silence; both mean the GPU notes in
 * README.md and CLAUDE.md need revisiting.
